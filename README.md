# ChivesCU
The original Chives project used a number of metrics pertaining to the physical environment in the city of Chicago to display areas that are affected by adverse conditions. The ChivesCU project aims to achieve the same goals for the Champaign-Urbana area.

## Spring 2022 Plan

### Data Management

Data to be added:
- SVI & Socioeconomic variables from CDC/ACS
- NDVI via Stuhlmacher
- Economic hardship (measured using ACS data)
- Diversity of plant species (measured by the Simpson index) (via Piper's project?) 
- Heat island effect (measured using land surface temperature data from NASA) via Stuhlmacher
- Number of trees (https://gis-cityofchampaign.opendata.arcgis.com)
- Walkability via CDC
- PLACES health synthetic estimates (asthma, cancer, hypertension)? 
- Average traffic (using IDOT volume estimates)

Overlays:
- Multiple municipality boundaries (varied b/c of rural-suburban edge)

### Web Mapping Application

Dev Goals:
- Fork Chicago Chives.
- Use cleaned data for working prototype

## Beyond Spring 2022:

Data to be added:
- Air quality estimates (PM2.5)
- Park spaces (via OpenStreeMap)
- Tree cover (% of land cover)
- Total observations of plant life
- Number of unique plant species
- Flood susceptibility
 
+ Collaborations to expand further
